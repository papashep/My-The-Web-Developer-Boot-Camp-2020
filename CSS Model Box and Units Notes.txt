The Box Model
-------------

    Four main properties:

        width and height
        border
        padding
        margin

    Nice to have:

        Border Radius       Allows you to change the curvature of the corners

    Display properties impacts how some of the above properties behave.

    Units - Percentages, EMS and REMS

    Everything in CSS is a box and those boxes have a couple of different properties.
    If we look at any web page just about everything is surrounded by a box
