HTML - Is a markup language - Hyper Text Markup Language
                              -     -    -      -
    It is about marking up a document /web pages giving text structure, rules and links to other pages,
    it does not contain any code. The style of the page is further enhanced by CSS.

    We create elements by writing tags, most tags consist of an opening closing tag (but not all).

        <p> I am a paragraph </p>

Essential elements that must be there (Boiler Plate)

    <!DOCTYPE html>                                 Flag to the browser saying we are using the latest HTML
    <html>                                          Root element everything must go below this
        <head>                                      One Head, One Document element.
                                                    The head is all metadata, info about your web page,any scripts that
                                                    you are loading, CSS stylesheets. Nothing that shows up in the page

            <title>My First Page</title>            Title of the document does not show in the web page,show's
                                                    in the web browser tabs. used by Google in finding the page
        </head>
        <body>
            <!-- Content Goes Here -->              Every thing is in the body
        </body>
    </html>

In vsCode Tips
    1. Create a new empty html file. Enter '!' then the 'tab key',it will automatically generate the boiler plate above.
    2. Command pallet <ctrl><shift>p to open the command pallet and select format document.


Headings <h1> to <h6>
---------------------

    Do not worry about the size of the heading as this can be altered within CSS
    Structure is important, for example you cannot have an h2 heading without an h1 heading and so on
        you cannot have an h3 heading without an h2 heading and so on
        h1
            h2
                h3
                h3
            h2
                h3
                    h4
                        h5
                            h6

Lists
-----

You can have ordered lists 'ol' or unordered lists 'ul'  both are defined the same

    <ol>
        <li> list item 1 </li>            Used to represent
        <li> list item 2 </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li> list item 1 </li>
        <li> list item 2 </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Bantam
            <!-- We can nest lists!! We have an ordered list within an unordered list -->
            <ol>
                <li>Silkie</li>
                <li>Polish</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Standard
            <ul>
                <li>Easter Egger</li>
                <li>Rhode Island Red</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

The anchor element <a> tag
--------------------------
The HTML <a> element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files,
email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.
Content within each <a> should indicate the link's destination.

    <p>You can reach Michael at:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://example.com">Website</a></li>
      <li><a href="mailto:m.bluth@example.com">Email</a></li>
      <li><a href="tel:+123456789">Phone</a></li>
    </ul>

With anchor tabs we need to use an attribute in the case above the attribute is the 'href=' (hyper text reference).
Attributes are pieces of information we can pass in to a tab, not just the anchor tab.

Anchor tabs are in-line.

The image element <img>
-----------------------
The HTML <img> element embeds an image into the document.
This does not have an opening and closing tag.

With an image we provide the url (where the image is), the src attribute
    <img class="fit-picture"
         src="/media/cc0-images/grapefruit-slice-332-332.jpg"
         alt="Grapefruit slice on top of a pile of other slices">

    <img src="pictures/stevie_chicks.jpg"
         alt="My pet chicken, Stevie Chicks">

    The alt attribute holds a text description of the image, which isn't mandatory but is incredibly useful
    for accessibility â€” screen readers read this description out to their users so they know what the
    image means.
    Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason:
        for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.

    There are many other attributes to achieve various purposes:

        Referrer/CORS control for security and privacy: see crossorigin and referrerpolicy.
        Use both width and height to set the intrinsic size of the image, allowing it to take up space before it
        loads, to mitigate content layout shifts.
        Responsive image hints with sizes and srcset (see also the <picture> element and our Responsive
        images tutorial).

    You can adjust the size with the width attribute but this is classes as bad practice as you should use CSS
    keeping your HTML document as clean as possible.
