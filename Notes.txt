Javascript/ HTML / CSS
----------------------

THE
PURPLE      CSS         - adjective    style, colour, fonts, etc
DINO        HTML        - nouns        structure of the web page
DANCED      JavaScript  - verbs        behavior / actions etc on the above

************************************************************************************************************************
HTML - Is a markup language - Hyper Text Markup Language
                              -     -    -      -
    It is about marking up a document /web pages giving text structure, rules and links to other pages,
    it does not contain any code. The style of the page is further enhanced by CSS.

    We create elements by writing tags, most tags consist of an opening closing tag (but not all).

        <p> I am a paragraph </p>

Essential elements that must be there (Boiler Plate)

    <!DOCTYPE html>                                 Flag to the browser saying we are using the latest HTML
    <html>                                          Root element everything must go below this
        <head>                                      One Head, One Document element.
                                                    The head is all metadata, info about your web page,any scripts that
                                                    you are loading, CSS stylesheets. Nothing that shows up in the page

            <title>My First Page</title>            Title of the document does not show in the web page,show's
                                                    in the web browser tabs. used by Google in finding the page
        </head>
        <body>
            <!-- Content Goes Here -->              Every thing is in the body
        </body>
    </html>

The term HTML5 referes to the new stuff in HTML, but it also refers to new stuff in CCS, Offline and storage and a bunch of
other developments.
Google: HTML Spec This is a documents that explains how HTML should work. It is up to the browsers to ensure HTML works
with the new features specified in the HTML Spec (standard), not all browsers may work.

In vsCode Tips
--------------
    1. Create a new empty html file. Enter '!' then the 'tab key',it will automatically generate the boiler plate above.
    2. Command pallet <ctrl><shift>p to open the command pallet and select format document.
    3. Emmet, the essential toolkit for web developers

Web site
--------

Inspect the element code for for www.stripe.com web site, it's a good example on how things
should be done.

Headings <h1> to <h6>
---------------------

    Do not worry about the size of the heading as this can be altered within CSS
    Structure is important, for example you cannot have an h2 heading without an h1 heading and so on
        you cannot have an h3 heading without an h2 heading and so on
        h1
            h2
                h3
                h3
            h2
                h3
                    h4
                        h5
                            h6

Lists
-----

You can have ordered lists 'ol' or unordered lists 'ul'  both are defined the same

    <ol>
        <li> list item 1 </li>            Used to represent
        <li> list item 2 </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li> list item 1 </li>
        <li> list item 2 </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Bantam
            <!-- We can nest lists!! We have an ordered list within an unordered list -->
            <ol>
                <li>Silkie</li>
                <li>Polish</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Standard
            <ul>
                <li>Easter Egger</li>
                <li>Rhode Island Red</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

The anchor element <a> tag
--------------------------
The HTML <a> element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files,
email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.
Content within each <a> should indicate the link's destination.

    <p>You can reach Michael at:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://example.com">Website</a></li>
      <li><a href="mailto:m.bluth@example.com">Email</a></li>
      <li><a href="tel:+123456789">Phone</a></li>
    </ul>

With anchor tabs we need to use an attribute in the case above the attribute is the 'href=' (hyper text reference).
Attributes are pieces of information we can pass in to a tab, not just the anchor tab.

Anchor tabs are in-line.

The image element <img>
-----------------------
The HTML <img> element embeds an image into the document.
This does not have an opening and closing tag.

With an image we provide the url (where the image is), the src attribute
    <img class="fit-picture"
         src="/media/cc0-images/grapefruit-slice-332-332.jpg"
         alt="Grapefruit slice on top of a pile of other slices">

    <img src="pictures/stevie_chicks.jpg"
         alt="My pet chicken, Stevie Chicks">

    The alt attribute holds a text description of the image, which isn't mandatory but is incredibly useful
    for accessibility — screen readers read this description out to their users so they know what the
    image means.
    Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason:
        for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.

    There are many other attributes to achieve various purposes:

        Referrer/CORS control for security and privacy: see crossorigin and referrerpolicy.
        Use both width and height to set the intrinsic size of the image, allowing it to take up space before it
        loads, to mitigate content layout shifts.
        Responsive image hints with sizes and srcset (see also the <picture> element and our Responsive
        images tutorial).

    You can adjust the size with the width attribute but this is classes as bad practice as you should use CSS
    keeping your HTML document as clean as possible.

Inline Elements and Block Elements
----------------------------------

SPAN and DIV    Important keywords Inline and Block Elements

Inline lements fit alongside each other and Block level elements take up a whole block of space
Inline Example : the anchor tab <a> and many more
Block Example: the paragrapgh tab <p>, the <h1>, <h2> tags and many more

We can change this behaviour later with CSS.

<div>  - The Content Division element
-------------------------------------
<div> is a block level element
This is a generic container to group and hold things together.
They allow us to style the content using CSS all at once.

<span> - Is a Generic Inline element
------------------------------------
<span> is an inline element
Inline generic container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group 
elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, 
such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. 
<span> is very much like a <div> element.
Usin CSS we can add styles to the <span> element.

An Assortments of different elements
------------------------------------

    <hr> The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element
    -------------------------------------------------
    No closing tag or content, it just generates an horizontal line on the page.
    You should use CSS to do this.

    <br> The Break element
    ----------------------
    No closing tag or content, is just causes a line break in text, usually within the paragraph.
    Note: Do not use <br> to create margins between paragraphs; wrap them in <p> elements and use the CSS margin 
    property to control their size.

    <sup> Superscript and <sub> Subscript elements
    ----------------------------------------------

    See last the chickens page at the bottom.

        <sup> Specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. 
        Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text. ie Representing 'C squared',
        or the 4th with the 'th' raised of f the base line.

        <sub> Specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. 
        Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text. ie O2 with the '2' lower 
        than the base line and in smaller text.

HTML Entity Codes
-----------------

These are special codes or special sequences that we can use inside our html that will result in different characters.
The string starts with an ampersand and ends with a simicolon.
The string may contain reserved html characters that would normally be invalid, also used in place of difficult
typed characters, such as copyright symbol, the browser interprets them and renders the correct character.

    Reserved html characters
    Character	Entity	Note
    &	        &amp;	Interpreted as the beginning of an entity or character reference.
    <	        &lt;	Interpreted as the beginning of a tag
    >	        &gt;	Interpreted as the ending of a tag
    "	        &quot;	Interpreted as the beginning and end of an attribute's value.

Introduction to Semantic Markup
-------------------------------

This is one of the new addition and trends in html ( to be expanded upon later)
The term Semantic - relating to meaning: "What purpose or role does that HTML element have?"
These elements all behave just like the <div> element except they have some meaning when read
They also help the browser when crawling the code to find all the links and sections.
The second reason for these semantics is accessibility making your code more accessible
to people using spring readers

Semantics in HTML

In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) 
of "a top level heading on your page."

<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>

By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an <h1> with a large font size to make it look like a heading 
(although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).

On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top level heading. Consider the following:

    <span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">Is this a top level heading?</span>

This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits 
as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.

HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. 
Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

    - Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
    - Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
    - Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching though endless divs with or without semantic or 
      namespaced classes
    - Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
    - Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" 
For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does 
it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to 
the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.

These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:

    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <main>
    <mark>
    <nav>
    <section>
    <summary>
    <time>

Saves using div all of the time.

    <main> element, represents the dominant content of the body of a document, it is strictly informative and
                    does not contribute to the documents outline such as <body. etc.

        It should exclude anything that may be repeated across pages, such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information,
        site logos, search forms unless it is the main function of the page.

    <nav> element, represents anything on the page that provides navigation links,
                   either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, 
                   tables of contents, and indexes.
        
        It not just for the top of the page it could be anywhere its required in the page.

    <section> element, this is quite a generic element, represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more 
                       specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document. Typically, 
                       but not always, sections have a heading.

    <article> element, represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to 
                       be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). 
                       Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, 
                       a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

        A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each article one 
        after another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained in an <article> element, possibly with one 
        or more <section>s within.   

            <article class="forecast">
                <h1>Weather forecast for Seattle</h1>
                <article class="day-forecast">
                    <h2>03 March 2018</h2>
                    <p>Rain.</p>
                </article>
                <article class="day-forecast">
                    <h2>04 March 2018</h2>
                    <p>Periods of rain.</p>
                </article>
                <article class="day-forecast">
                    <h2>05 March 2018</h2>
                    <p>Heavy rain.</p>
                </article>
            </article>  

        Usage notes
            - Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1>-<h6> element) as a child 
              of the <article> element.
            - When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. 
              For example, the comments of a blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing 
              the blog post.
            - Author information of an <article> element can be provided through the <address> element, but it doesn't 
              apply to nested <article> elements.
            - The publication date and time of an <article> element can be described using the datetime attribute 
              of a <time> element. Note that the pubdate attribute of <time> is no longer a part of the W3C HTML5 standard. 

    <aside> element, represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main 
                     content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.  

        Usage notes
            Do not use the <aside> element to tag parenthesized text, as this kind of text is considered part of the main flow

    <header> element, represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. 
                      It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

    <footer> element, represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. 
                      A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, 
                      copyright data or links to related documents.
    
    You can have more than one header and footer on a page, you do not have to specify both, you can
    have either a <header> or a <footer> or <both>

    <time> element, represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate 
                    dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom 
                    features such as reminders.

                    It may represent one of the following:

                    - A time on a 24-hour clock.
                    - A precise date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone information).
                    - A valid time duration.

                    <p>The Cure will be celebrating their 40th anniversary on <time datetime="2018-07-07">July 7</time>
                       in London's Hyde Park.</p>

                    <p>The concert starts at <time datetime="20:00">20:00</time>
                       and you'll be able to enjoy the band for at least 
                       <time datetime="PT2H30M">2h 30m</time>.</p>

                Attributes
                    Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global attributes.

                    datetime
                        This attribute indicates the time and/or date of the element and must be in 
                        one of the formats described below.
        
        Usage notes
            This element is for presenting dates and times in a machine readable format. For example, 
            this can help a user agent offer to add an event to a user's calendar.

            This element should not be used for dates prior to the introduction of the Gregorian 
            calendar (due to complications in calculating those dates).

            The datetime value (the machine-readable value of the datetime) is the value of the 
            element’s datetime attribute, which must be in the proper format (see below). If the element does not
            have a datetime attribute, it must NOT have any element descendants, and the datetime
            value is the elements childs text content

        Valid datetime values
            a valid year string: 2011
            a valid month string: 2011-11

    <figcaption> element, represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its 
                          parent <figure> element. In the example below it puts the caption (<figcaption>)
                          on the bottom of the elephant image.

                        <figure>

    Tables
    ------

    We three basic elements to section off our table, these do not do much except break your table
    into logical sections:

        - <thead></thead>,  see MDN for attributes
        - <tbody></tbody>,  see MDN for attributes
        - <tfoot></tfoot>,  see MDN for attributes
    
    <thead> element, defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table.
                     See MDN for more information.
                    
    <tbody> element, encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the 
                     body of the table (<table>). 

        Usage notes:
        ------------
            - If the table includes a <thead> block (to semantically identify header rows), 
              the <tbody> block must come after it.
            - If you use <tbody>, you can't also have table rows (<tr> elements) which are direct children of 
              the <table> but not included inside the <tbody>. 
              All non-header and non-footer rows must be inside the <tbody> if one is used.
            - When printing a document, the <thead> and <tfoot> elements specify information that may be 
              the same—or at least very similar—on every page of a multi-page table, while the <tbody> 
              element's contents generally will differ from page to page.
            - When a table is presented in a screen context (such as a window) which is not large enough to 
              display the entire table, the user agent may let the user scroll the contents of 
              the <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, and <caption> blocks separately from one another for the same parent table.
            - You may use more than one <tbody> per table as long as they are all consecutive. 
              This lets you divide the rows in large tables into sections, each of which may be separately 
              formatted if so desired.

    <tfoot> element, element defines a set of rows summarizing the columns of the table.

    Forms
    -----

    Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users — most commonly they are 
    used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface. 
    When you submit a form an http request will be sent and the results will be displayed back.

    <form> element, itself is a shell or container that does not have any visual impact.
                    We then fill the form with a collection of inputs, checkboxes, labels, buttons, etc

                    The form element represents a document:

                        - section containing interactive  controls for submitting data.
                        - The action attribute specifies WHERE the form data should be sent.
                        - The method attribute specifies which HTTP method should be used.

        Atttributes:

            action
                The URL that processes the form submission. This value can be overridden by a formaction 
                attribute on a <button>, <input type="submit">, or <input type="image"> element.
            
            enctype
                If the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME type of the form submission. 
                Possible values:
                    - application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value.
                    - multipart/form-data: Use this if the form contains <input> elements with type=file.
                    - text/plain: Introduced by HTML5 for debugging purposes.
                This value can be overridden by formenctype attributes on <button>, <input type="submit">, 
                or <input type="image"> elements.

            method
                The HTTP method to submit the form with. Possible (case insensitive) values:
                    - post: The POST method; form data sent as the request body.
                    - get: The GET method; form data appended to the action URL with a ? separator. 
                           Use this method when the form has no side-effects.
                    - dialog: When the form is inside a <dialog>, closes the dialog on submission.
                This value is overridden by formmethod attributes on <button>, <input type="submit">, 
                or <input type="image"> elements.

            novalidate
                This Boolean attribute indicates that the form shouldn't be validated when submitted. 
                If this attribute is not set (and therefore the form is validated), it can be overridden 
                    - by a formnovalidate attribute on a <button>, <input type="submit">, 
                    - or <input type="image"> element belonging to the form.
            
            target
                Indicates where to display the response after submitting the form. In HTML 4, this is the 
                name/keyword for a frame. In HTML5, it is a name/keyword for a browsing context 
                (for example, tab, window, or iframe). The following keywords have special meanings:
                    - _self (default): Load into the same browsing context as the current one.
                    - _blank: Load into a new unnamed browsing context.
                    - _parent: Load into the parent browsing context of the current one. 
                               If no parent, behaves the same as _self.
                    _top: Load into the top-level browsing context (i.e., the browsing context that 
                          is an ancestor of the current one and has no parent). 
                          If no parent, behaves the same as _self.
                This value can be overridden by a formtarget attribute on a <button>, <input type="submit">, 
                or <input type="image"> element.   

Form Inputs
-----------

    There are many different possible elements for form inputs

        <input> element, is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data 
                         from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, 
                         depending on the device and user agent. 
                         There is no closing tag.
                         The <input> element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer 
                         number of combinations of input types and attributes.

                         There are a possible 20+ types of input ranging from date pickers to checkboxes.
                         The type attribute is where the magic happens. Changing type dramatically alters
                         the input's behavior and appearance..

            Input types:

                <input> types
                        How an <input> works varies considerably depending on the value of its type attribute, 
                        hence the different types are covered in their own separate reference pages. 
                        If this attribute is not specified, the default type adopted is text.

                        The available types are as follows:

                            Type	    Description	                                               	        Spec

                                            default validation when supported. Displays a numeric keypad 
                                            in some devices with dynamic keypads.		                     HTML5
                            
                            password	    A single-line text field whose value is obscured. 
                                            Will alert user if site is not secure.

                                            Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value. 
                                            May include a delete icon in supporting browsers that can be 
                                            used to clear the field. Displays a search icon instead of enter 
                                            key on some devices with dynamic keypads.		                 HTML5

                                            are automatically removed from the input value.		
                            
                            time	        A control for entering a time value with no time zone.		     HTML5
                            
                            url	            A field for entering a URL. Looks like a text input, but 
                                            has validation parameters and relevant keyboard in supporting 
                                            browsers and devices with dynamic keyboards.		             HTML5

                                            and a week number with no time zone.		                     HTML5
                            
                            Obsolete values:
                            
                            datetime	    A control for entering a date and time (hour, minute, second, 
                                            and fraction of a second) based on UTC time zone.		         HTML5

            Attributes:

                accept
                    Valid for the file input type only, the accept attribute defines which file types are 
                    selectable in a file upload control. See the file input type.

                alt
                    Valid for the image button only, the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, 
                    displaying the value of the attribute if the image src is missing or otherwise fails to load. 
                    See the image input type.

                autocomplete
                    (Not a Boolean attribute!) The autocomplete attribute takes as its value a space-separated 
                    string that describes what, if any, type of autocomplete functionality the input 
                    should provide. 
                    A typical implementation of autocomplete simply recalls previous values entered in the same 
                    input field, but more complex forms of autocomplete can exist. For instance, a browser 
                    could integrate with a device's contacts list to autocomplete email addresses in an email 
                    input field. See Values in The HTML autocomplete attribute for permitted values.

                    The autocomplete attribute is valid on hidden, text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, 
                    week, time, datetime-local, number, range, color, and password. 
                    This attribute has no effect on input types that do not return numeric or text data, being 
                    valid for all input types except checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types.

                    See The HTML autocomplete attribute for additional information, including information on 
                    password security and how autocomplete is slightly different for hidden than for other input types.

                autofocus
                    A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input should automatically have focus 
                    when the page has finished loading (or when the <dialog> containing the element has been displayed).

                    Note: An element with the autofocus attribute may gain focus before the DOMContentLoaded 
                          event is fired.

                          No more than one element in the document may have the autofocus attribute. If put on more 
                          than one element, the first one with the attribute receives focus.

                          The autofocus attribute cannot be used on inputs of type hidden, since hidden 
                          inputs cannot be focused.

                    Warning: Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using 
                          screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. 
                          When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers "teleport" their user to the form control 
                          without warning them beforehand.

                    Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the autofocus attribute. 
                    Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. 
                    The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. 
                    While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, 
                    the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user 
                    on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content.

                capture
                    Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the file input type only, 
                    the capture attribute defines which media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used 
                    to capture a new file for upload with file upload control in supporting scenarios. 
                    See the file input type.

                checked
                    Valid for both radio and checkbox types, checked is a Boolean attribute. 
                    If present on a radio type, it indicates that that radio button is the currently selected 
                    one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it 
                    indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). 
                    It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state 
                    is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. 
                    (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.)

                    Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in 
                          the submitted data if they are currently checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) 
                          of the checked controls are submitted.

                    For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of cherry, and the checkbox is 
                          checked, the form data submitted will include fruit=cherry. 
                          If the checkbox isn't active, it isn't listed in the form data at all.
                          the default value for checkboxes and radio buttons is on.

                dirname
                    Valid for text and search input types only, the dirname attribute enables the submission of 
                    the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two 
                    name/value pairs: the first being the name and value, the second being the value of 
                    the dirname as the name with the value of ltr or rtl being set by the browser.

                        <form action="page.html" method="post">
                        <label>Fruit: <input type="text" name="fruit" dirname="fruit.dir" value="cherry"></label>
                        <input type="submit"/>
                        </form>
                        <!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit.dir=ltr -->
                    When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the name / value pair of fruit=cherry and 
                    the dirname / direction pair of fruit.dir=ltr to be sent.

                disabled
                    A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact 
                    with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other 
                    form of indication that the field is not available for use.

                    Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the click event, and disabled inputs are not 
                    submitted with the form.

                    Note: Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default persist the dynamic 
                          disabled state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to 
                          control this feature.

                form
                    A string specifying the <form> element with which the input is associated (that is, its form owner). 
                    This string's value, if present, must match the id of a <form> element in the same document. 
                    If this attribute isn't specified, the <input> element is associated with the nearest 
                    containing form, if any.

                    The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included 
                    with a form elsewhere in the document.

                    Note: An input can only be associated with one form.

                formaction
                    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information.

                formenctype
                    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information.

                formmethod
                    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information.

                formnovalidate
                    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information.

                formtarget
                    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information.

                height
                    Valid for the image input button only, the height is the height of the image file to display 
                    to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type.

                id
                    Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique 
                    identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify 
                    the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>'s for attribute to 
                    link the label with the form control. See <label>.

                inputmode
                    Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual 
                    keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. 
                    Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search.

                list
                    The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located 
                    in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user 
                    for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included 
                    in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can 
                    select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

                    It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, 
                    number, range, and color.

                    Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, 
                    checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types.

                    Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks 
                    along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. 
                    Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types.

                    See the <datalist> element.

                max
                    Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines 
                    the greatest value in the range of permitted values. 
                    If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. 
                    If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value.

                    There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value 
                    of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; 
                    for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM.

                maxlength
                    Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of 
                    characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer 
                    value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, 
                    the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the 
                    value of minlength.

                    The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field 
                    is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users 
                    from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. 
                    See Client-side validation for more information.

                min
                    Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most 
                    negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is 
                    less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. 
                    If the value of the min attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value.

                    This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. 
                    If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. 
                    If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the 
                    min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. 
                    See Client-side validation for more information.

                    There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), 
                    the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may 
                    wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM.

                minlength
                    Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of 
                    characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. 
                    This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified 
                    by maxlength. 
                    If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length.

                    The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is 
                    fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. 
                    See Client-side validation for more information.

                multiple
                    The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses 
                    in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. 
                    See the email and file input type.

                name
                    A string specifying a name for the input control. 
                    This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted.

                    You should assign a name vale to every input that you use.

                    What's in a name:    
                    Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no name specified, 
                    or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! 
                    (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.)

                    There are two special cases:

                    _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value 
                                is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form.
                    isindex:    For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed.

                    name and radio buttons
                        The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons.

                        Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. 
                        Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any 
                        currently-selected radio button in the same group. 
                        The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted,

                        When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, 
                        that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, 
                        if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group 
                        is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. 
                        In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. 
                        If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name 
                        group is reached.

                        Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all 
                        the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in 
                        the source order.

                        HTMLFormElement.elements:
                        When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's 
                        HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and 
                        another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used:

                            let form = document.querySelector("form");

                            let guestName = form.elements.guest;
                            let hatSize = form.elements["hat-size"];                
                        When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and 
                        hatSize the object for the hat-size field.

                        Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the 
                        form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference 
                        to the corresponding input.

                    pattern
                        The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's value must 
                        match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. 
                        It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as 
                        documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling 
                        the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, 
                        instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

                        If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression 
                        is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. 
                        If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, 
                        constraint validation will prevent form submission.

                        Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including 
                             explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the 
                             requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title 
                             as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. 
                             The tooltip is an enhancement.

                             See Client-side validation for more information.

                    placeholder
                        The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind 
                        of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides 
                        a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. 
                        The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is 
                        expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is "First Name", 
                        a suitable placeholder might be "e.g. Mustafa".

                        Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your 
                        form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: 
                        The Input (Form Input) element for more information.

                    readonly
                        A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit 
                        the value of the input. 
                        The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, 
                        datetime-local, number, and password input types.

                        See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information.

                    required
                        required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value 
                        for the input before the owning form can be submitted. 
                        The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, 
                        datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file.

                        See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information.

                    size
                        Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is 
                        shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. 
                        The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. 
                        For password and text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, 
                        and for others, it is pixels. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute.

                    src
                        Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file 
                        to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type.

                    step
                        Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, 
                        the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to.

                        If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit 
                        type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. 
                        The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, 
                        which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed 
                        (barring other constraints, such as min and max).

                        If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and 
                        range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments 
                        of the step value, up to the max value, if specified.

                        For example, if you have <input type="number" min="10" step="2">, then any even 
                        integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type="number">, any integer is valid, 
                        but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. 
                        For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value 
                        would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type="number" min="-5.2">

                        Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, 
                        the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass.

                        The step attribute is expressed in seconds. The step scale factor is 1000 
                        (which converts the seconds to milliseconds, as used in the other algorithms). 
                        The default step is 60 seconds.

                        See Client-side validation for more information.

                    tabindex
                        Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute 
                        indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate 
                        to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are 
                        focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would 
                        require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the 
                        risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly.

                    title
                        Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text 
                        representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. 
                        Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. 
                        The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. 
                        Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control's id attribute. 
                        See Labels below.

                    type
                        A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, 
                        a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), 
                        the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field.

                        Permitted values are listed in <input> types above.

                    value
                        The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and 
                        from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access 
                        the respective HTMLInputElement object's value property. 
                        The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for 
                        checkbox, radio, and hidden.

                    width
                        Valid for the image input button only, the width is the width of the image file to 
                        display to represent the graphical submit button. 
                        See the image input type.

                Non-standard attributes
                -----------------------
                The following non-standard attributes are also available on some browsers. As a general rule, 
                you should avoid using them unless it can't be helped.

                    autocorrect	
                        A string indicating whether or not autocorrect is on or off. Safari only.

                    incremental	
                        Whether or not to send repeated search events to allow updating live search 
                        results while the user is still editing the value of the field. 
                        WebKit and Blink only (Safari, Chrome, Opera, etc.).

                    mozactionhint	
                        A string indicating the type of action that will be taken when the user presses 
                        the Enter or Return key while editing the field; this is used to determine 
                        an appropriate label for that key on a virtual keyboard. Firefox for Android only.

                    orient	
                        Sets the orientation of the range slider. Firefox only.

                    results	
                        The maximum number of items that should be displayed in the drop-down list 
                        of previous search queries. Safari only.

                    webkitdirectory	
                        A Boolean indicating whether or not to only allow the user to choose a 
                        directory (or directories, if multiple is also present)

                    autocorrect 
                        A Safari extension, the autocorrect attribute is a string which indicates whether 
                        or not to activate automatic correction while the user is editing this field. 
                        Permitted values are:

                            on
                                Enable automatic correction of typos, as well as processing of text 
                                substitutions if any are configured.
                            off
                                Disable automatic correction and text substitutions.

                    incremental 
                        The Boolean attribute incremental is a WebKit and Blink extension 
                        (so supported by Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc.) which, if present, tells the user 
                        agent to process the input as a live search. As the user edits the value of the field, 
                        the user agent sends search events to the HTMLInputElement object representing the search box. 
                        This allows your code to update the search results in real time as the user edits the search.

                        If incremental is not specified, the search event is only sent when the user explicitly 
                        initiates a search (such as by pressing the Enter or Return key while editing the field).

                        The search event is rate-limited so that it is not sent more more frequently than an 
                        implementation-defined interval.

                    mozactionhint 
                        A Mozilla extension, supported by Firefox for Android, which provides a hint as to what 
                        sort of action will be taken if the user presses the Enter or Return key while editing 
                        the field. This information is used to decide what kind of label to use on the Enter key 
                        on the virtual keyboard.

                        Note: This has been standardized as the global attribute enterkeyhint, but is not yet 
                        widely implemented. To see the status of the change being implemented in Firefox, 
                        see bug 1490661.

                        Permitted values are: go, done, next, search, and send. The browser decides, 
                        using this hint, what label to put on the enter key.

                    orient 
                        Sets the orientation of the range slider. Firefox only. 

                    results 
                        The results attribute—supported only by Safari—is a numeric value that lets you override 
                        the maximum number of entries to be displayed in the <input> element's natively-provided 
                        drop-down menu of previous search queries.

                        The value must be a non-negative decimal number. If not provided, or an invalid value 
                        is given, the browser's default maximum number of entries is used.

                    webkitdirectory 
                        The Boolean webkitdirectory attribute, if present, indicates that only directories 
                        should be available to be selected by the user in the file picker interface. 
                        See HTMLInputElement.webkitdirectory for additional details and examples.

                        Note: Though originally implemented only for WebKit-based browsers, webkitdirectory is also 
                        usable in Microsoft Edge as well as Firefox 50 and later. 
                        However, even though it has relatively broad support, it is still not standard and should 
                        not be used unless you have no alternative.

            The <input> element is so powerful because of its attributes; the type attribute, described with 
            examples above, being the most important. Since every <input> element, regardless of type, is based 
            on the HTMLInputElement interface, they technically share the exact same set of attributes. 
            However, in reality, most attributes have an effect on only a specific subset of input types. 
            In addition, the way some attributes impact an input depends on the input type, impacting 
            different input types in different ways.

            This section provides a table listing all the attributes with a brief description. 
            This table is followed by a list describing each attribute in greater detail, along with which 
            input types they are associated with.Those that are common to most or all input types are defined 
            in greater detail below. Attributes that are unique to particular input types—or attributes which 
            are common to all input types but have special behaviors when used on a given input type—are 
            instead documented on those types' pages. This element includes the global attributes. 
            Those with extra importance as it relates to <input> are highlighted.

        Methods
        -------

        The following methods are provided by the HTMLInputElement interface which represents <input> elements 
        in the DOM. Also available are those methods specified by the parent interfaces, HTMLElement, 
        Element, Node, and EventTarget.

            checkValidity()
                Immediately runs the validity check on the element, triggering the document to fire the invalid 
                event at the element if the value isn't valid.

            reportValidity()
                Returns true if the element's value passes validity checks; otherwise, returns false.

            select()
                Selects the entire content of the <input> element, if the element's content is selectable. 
                For elements with no selectable text content (such as a visual color picker or 
                calendar date input), this method does nothing.

            setCustomValidity()
                Sets a custom message to display if the input element's value isn't valid.

            setRangeText()
                Sets the contents of the specified range of characters in the input element to a given string. 
                A selectMode parameter is available to allow controlling how the existing content is affected.

            setSelectionRange()
                Selects the specified range of characters within a textual input element. Does nothing for 
                inputs which aren't presented as text input fields.

            stepDown()
                Decrements the value of a numeric input by one, by default, or by the specified 
                number of units.

            stepUp()
                Increments the value of a numeric input by one or by the specified number of units.

        CSS
        ----
        Inputs, being replaced elements, have a few features not applicable to non form elements. 
        There are CSS selectors that can specification target form controls based on their UI features,
         also known as UI pseudo-classes. 
         The input element can also be targeted by type with attribute selectors. 
         There are some properties that are especially useful as well.

        UI pseudo-classes
        Captions super relevant to the <input> element:

            :enabled	
                Any currently enabled element that can be activated (selected, clicked on, 
                typed into, etc.) or accept focus and also has a disabled state, 
                in which it can't be activated or accept focus.

            :disabled	
                Any currently disabled element that has an enabled state, meaning it otherwise 
                could be activated (selected, clicked on, typed into, etc.) or accept focus 
                were it not disabled.

            :read-only	
                Element not editable by the user

            :read-write	
                Element that is editable by the user.

            :placeholder-shown	
                Element that is currently displaying placeholder text, including <input> and 
                <textarea> elements with the placeholder attribute present that has, as of 
                yet, no value.

            :default	
                Form elements that are the default in a group of related elements. 
                Matches checkbox and radio input types that were checked on page load or render.

            :checked	
                Matches checkbox and radio input types that are currently checked 
                (and the (<option> in a <select> that is currently selected).

            :indeterminate	
                checkbox elements whose indeterminate property is set to true by JavaScript, 
                radio elements, when all radio buttons with the same name value in the form are 
                unchecked, and <progress> elements in an indeterminate state

            :valid	
                Form controls that can have constraint validation applied and are currently valid.

            :invalid	
                Form controls that have constraint validation applied and are currently not valid. 
                Matches a form control whose value doesn't match the constraints set on it by it's 
                attributes, such as required, pattern , step and max.

            :in-range	
                A non-empty input whose current value is within the range limits specified by 
                the min and max attributes and the step .

            :out-of-range	
                A non-empty input whose current value is NOT within the range limits specified by 
                the min and max attributes or does not adhere to the step constraint.

            :required	
                <input>, <select>, or <textarea> element that has the required attribute set on it. 
                Only matches elements that can be required. 
                The attribute included on a non-requirable element will not make for a match.

            :optional	
                <input>, <select>, or <textarea> element that does NOT have the required attribute 
                set on it. Does not match elements that can't be required.

            :blank	
                <input> and <textarea> elements that currently have no value.

            :user-invalid	
                Similar to :invalid, but is activated on blur. 
                Matches invalid input but only after the user interaction, such as by focusing on the control, 
                leaving the control, or attempting to submit the form containing the invalid control.   

        See MDN for example of usage, select <input> in the search             

    General Form Elements
    ---------------------

        <label> element, represents a caption for an item in a user interface.  
                         Associating a <label> with an <input> element offers some major advantages:

                            - The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; 
                              it is programatically associated with it too. This means that, for example, a screen 
                              reader will read out the label when the user is focused on the form input, making it 
                              easier for an assistive technology user to understand what data should be entered.
                            - You can click the associated label to focus/activate the input, as well as the input itself. 
                              This increased hit area provides an advantage to anyone trying to activate the input, including 
                              those using a touch-screen device.

                        To associate the <label> with an <input> element, you need to give the <input> an id attribute. 
                        The <label> then needs a for an attribute whose value is the same as the input's id.

                            <div class="preference">
                                <label for="cheese">Do you like cheese?</label>
                                <input type="checkbox" name="cheese" id="cheese">
                            </div>

                            <div class="preference">
                                <label for="peas">Do you like peas?</label>
                                <input type="checkbox" name="peas" id="peas">
                            </div>

                        Alternatively, you can nest the <input> directly inside the <label>, in which case the for and id 
                        attributes are not needed because the association is implicit:

                            <label>Do you like peas?
                                <input type="checkbox" name="peas">
                            </label>
        
            Other usage notes:
            ------------------

                The form control that the label is labeling is called the labeled control of the label element. 
                One input can be associated with multiple labels.
                When a <label> is clicked or tapped and it is associated with a form control, 
                the resulting click event is also raised for the associated control.  

                    <div class="preference">
                        <label for="cheese">Do you like cheese?</label>
                        <input type="checkbox" name="cheese" id="cheese">
                    </div>

                    <div class="preference">
                        <label for="peas">Do you like peas?</label>
                        <input type="checkbox" name="peas" id="peas">
                    </div>   

                Only one element on a page can have a given id.   

                Don't place interactive elements such as anchors or buttons inside a label. 
                Doing so makes it difficult for people to activate the form input associated with the label.

                An <input> element with a type="button" declaration and a valid value attribute does not 
                need a label associated with it. Doing so may actually interfere with how 
                assistive technology parses the button input. The same applies for the <button> element.    

                Placing heading elements within a <label> interferes with many kinds of assistive technology, 
                because headings are commonly used as a navigation aid. If the label's text needs to be adjusted 
                visually, use CSS classes applied to the <label> element instead.

                If a form, or a section of a form needs a title, use the <legend> element placed within a <fieldset>. 

        <button> element, represents a clickable button, used to submit forms or anywhere in a document for accessible, 
                          standard button functionality. 
                          By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, 
                          but you can change <buttons> appearance with CSS.

                            <button class="favorite styled" type="button">Add to favorites</button>
            
                A submit button with the attribute formaction set, but without an associated form does nothing. 
                You have to set a form owner, either by wrapping it in a <form> or set the attribute form 
                to the id of the form.

                        <button>any text here will try to submit the form</button>
                        ----------------------------------------------------------

                    By assigning the type attribute html will not try to submit the form when it is selected

                        <button type="button">Your button text</button>

                    

                <button> elements are much easier to style than <input> elements. 
                You can add inner HTML content (think <i>, <br>, or even <img>), and use ::after and ::before 
                pseudo-elements for complex rendering.

                If your buttons are not for submitting form data to a server, be sure to set their type attribute 
                to button. Otherwise they will try to submit form data and to load the (nonexistent) response, 
                possibly destroying the current state of the document.

        <button class="favorite styled" type="button">Add to favorites</button>
